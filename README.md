# Fashion MNIST Clustering
In this project, I used the Fashion MNIST dataset to explore image grouping using unsupervised learning. After preprocessing and scaling the data, I applied PCA to reduce dimensionality for easier clustering. I implemented three algorithms â€” KMeans, DBSCAN, and Hierarchical Clustering to identify similar clothing patterns. Finally, I evaluated their performance using Silhouette Score and Davies-Bouldin Index and visualized the clusters in 2D.
